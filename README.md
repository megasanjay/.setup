# .setup

A set of scripts to install and configure my development environment. Meant to be used on a fresh install of Ubuntu.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   cd
   git clone https://github.com/megasanjay/.setup.git
   ```

2. Run the setup script

   ```bash
   cd .setup
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Follow the prompts where needed

## Acknowledgements

This setup script is heavily inspired by [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub)'s setup script. I found DHH's starting setup to be a bit too much for my taste, so I decided to make my own.
